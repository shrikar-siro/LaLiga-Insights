# LaLiga-Insights

This dynamic web application tracks 2023-2024 LaLiga season player statistics, displaying important individual player statistics such as appearances and goals scored.

The application displays the CSV file in its entirety within the web application, with users having the ability to set filters based on players' position, country, and/or team to narrow down the data points evaluated. 

Furthermore, graphs showing key statistics, such as the distribution of goals by country and the goals scored per team, are displayed. This is to show player data in a more intuitive, engaging manner and reveal any patterns or relationships between data.

Since the application is dynamic, any parameters the user sets will affect the data displayed, including the graphs displayed.
